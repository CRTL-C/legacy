Write a simple python script for collecting all your key logs.


### Usage
 nohup python3 keylogger.py & command, it'll start to log your strokes: The meaning of nohup is ‘no hangup‘. When nohup command use with ‘&’ then it doesn’t return to shell command prompt after running the command in the background.


Start logger
```
$:~/keyloger $ nohup python3 learn.py &
 
```
nohup stands for 'no hangup'. When we use  nohup command with '&' , it doesn't returns shell command prompt and keep running logger in background. :)



For stopping logger
```
$:~/keyloger $ fg (type fg command then hit CRTL-C)

```

#### Requirements
